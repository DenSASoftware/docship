# The add subcommand

This subcommand is just a dummy for other possible subcommands this cli application could have. Imagine this program had multiple subcommands with different flags and a documentation was necessary. This documentation could be an offline-version of [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/).

This command adds two numbers together. Example:
```bash
docship add 5 7
```
This will print 12, unless run on an intel pentium processor where you can enjoy a whole new take on mathematics. I know the famous bug only affected floating point numbers, but I just wanted to make this joke.
